## Why I built this app

The purpose of this web application is to add a nice visual representation of Carl Sagan's cosmic calendar. The concept was popularized in Carl Sagan's book The Dragons of Eden (1977) and on his television series Cosmos. Sagan goes on to extend the comparison in terms of surface area, explaining that if the Cosmic Calendar is scaled to the size of a football field, then "all of human history would occupy an area the size of his hand".
